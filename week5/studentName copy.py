# Write a program that will read in the data for the data structure above, ie
# reads in a studentâ€™s name, then keeps reading in their modules and grades (until 
# the user enters a blank module name). You can break this up into two parts:
#   a. Just read in the module names until the user enters blank,
#   b. Then read in the grade as well
# This program can just read in one student (and their module details).
